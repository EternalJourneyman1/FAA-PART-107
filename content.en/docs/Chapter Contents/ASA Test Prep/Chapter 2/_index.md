# Chapter 2 - National Airspace System

## Introduction

- 2 categories of airspace
  - regulatory: Class: A, B, C, D, & E (**controlled**)
  - non regulatory: Class: G (**uncontrolled**)

## NOTAM

- NOTAM's provide information from FAA about airspace
  - 1: Distant
  - 2: Flight Data Center
  - 3: Pointers
  - 4: Special Activity Airspace
  - 5: Military

### Questions

- Most comprehensive information is given by US Chart Supplement
- remote pics must check NOTAMS before flights
- NOTAM will contain information about public gatherings of large groups
- FDC NOTAMS usually contain temporary flight restrictions
- Time-critical information is provided by NOTAMs
- One purpose of issuing temporary flight restriction (TFR) is to protect public figures
- TFR applies to all aircraft
- FAA publications provide flight information and ATC procedure in the Aeronautical Information Manual

## Airspace Classification

- many controlled airspace begins at either 700 or 1200 feet agl
  - 700 is magenta
  - 1200 is blue vignette
  - floors higher are by number
- Class G (Uncontrolled) is usually 700 or 1200 AGL
- Prohibited space : blocks airspace such as white house
- Restricted : presence of unusual often invisible hazards to aircraft
- Warning area : same as restricted but in international airspace
- Alert area : high volume of pilot training or unusual type of aerial activity
- MOA's : airspace of separating military training from IFR traffic
- MTR's Routes for military low-altitude high-speed training
- **CLASS B AIRSPACE**

- **CLASS E AIRSPACE** anywhere no magenta or blue - starting @ _1200ft_ **AGL**

- **CLASS G AIRSPACE** - <700 Feet inside class E and up to 1200 anywhere outside

### Questions

Exercise extreme caution when operating in a MOA  
Prior to operating in a MOA refer to the legend for special use airspace phone number and contact the controlling agency for traffic.

## Topography

- Prime meridian passes through Greenwhich, England, from here measures are made East & west.
- Remote Pic should be familiar with all information in a sectional chart
- each degree is divided into 60 minutes (') and each minute into seconds ('').

### Questions

- Lines of longitude pass the equater at right angles
- Airports with _control towers_ underlying class B, C,D, & E are shown in blue.
- Small red flag symbol represents a visual checkpoint for manned aircraft; expect higher volumes of air traffic to be there.
- All parachute information in the US are in the Chart Supplement US
- To contact ATC use Frequency starting with "CT"
<!--SR:!2023-05-28,20,290!2023-05-14,6,230!2023-05-21,9,248!2023-05-27,15,268!2023-05-21,9,228-->

## Airport Operations

- remote pic must be aware of all traffic patterns near airports.
- Remote pic must avoid operating anywhere that the presence may interfere with airpro operations.
- Remote pic must yelid right-of-way
- Remote pic should contact ATC as early as possible prior to operation in class B,C, & D & within lateral bounds.

### Questions

- manned aircraft when approaching class G airspace w/o control tower will make all turns to the left unless otherwise indicated
- Entries into traffic patterns by manned aircraft while descending should be avoided.
- To enter airport SIDA you must have airport-issued/ approved ID

## Airport Markings & Signs

- Runway numbers are mareked by the magnetic heading (180 degree = 18 on runway)
- Runways with the same heading and multiple runways are marked with LEFT, RIGHT, or CENTER
- Desginated beginning of the runway is called the threshold, thresholds that are not at the very beginning are called displaced thresholds.
- Stopways are only for runoff and are marked by chevrons
- Taxiways are identified with continuous yellow lines
- Taxiway to runway may have a holding marker
- Six types of signs are airports
  - _mandatoy instruction sign_: red background, white text
  - _location sign_: black with yellow yext
  - _direction sign_: yellow with black text
  - _destination sign_: yellow with black text + arrows â–¶
  - _information sign_: yellow with black text
  - _runway distance remaining_: black with white text (indicates number of feet remaining)

### Questions

- The numbers 9 and 27 on a runway indcate::087 degrees and 270 degrees
<!--SR:!2023-05-19,7,230-->
- Turning on to a taxiway from another taxiway the directional sign is to indcate designation and direction of taxiway leading out of an intersection.
- When approaching holding lines from the side with continuous lines, pilot should not cross w/o atc clearance
- Runway hold position signs denotes protected area for aircraft approaching/departing runway.
- Purpose of runway hold position is to hold aircraft short of the runway
- Holding position signs have white inspection on red background
- No entry signs are for areas where aircraft are prohibited from entering.
- Aeronatuical Information Manual contains explanations of airport signs and markings
- You are considered to be clear of all runways when you are on double soild yellow lines

## Collision Avoidance

- Aircraft that appear to have no lateral or vertical motion, but an increase in size are heading to you. take evasive action
- avoid operations near moored ballons and helicopters; helicopters usually operate near wire rich areas
- Static electricity can build up when aircraft comes in contact with rain, snow, fog, sleet, hail volcanic ash & dust. (p-static)
- Aircraft without good static discharging may develop a corona which may discharge from any extremity.
- Visible dicharge of static electricity is referred to as "st Elmo's fire"
- FAA prohibit the disruption of aviation activity by any person on the ground or in the air from lasers.
- When laser operations are taken place NOTAM's are issued for the aviaction community.
- Lasers are able to create temporary vision impariments miels from location and they may cause permanent eye damage.
- Power plants or idustrial facilities may exahuset thermal plumes causing unstable casses and air disturbance.
- When a plume is visible be aware that the plume may have visible and invisibel characteristics
- Skeletal structures may have guy wires that extend 1500 feet, they should be avoided by 2000 feet
- Collisions with wildlife should be reported to the FAA via (wildlife strike report system)

### Questions

- Most midair collisiosn occur during clear days
- Remote pilots should systematically focus on different segments of the sky for short interverals when scanning for traffic
- Guy wires, which support antenna towers, should be avoided by at least 2000 feet
- Remote pilots should rely on visual scanning for wire strike avoidance
- remote pic should file a wildlife strike report when they collide with a bird or wild life.
- Most effective way to scan for traffic would be to use 10 degree increments of the sky
- When approaching a aircraft head on both pilots should adjust course to the right.
